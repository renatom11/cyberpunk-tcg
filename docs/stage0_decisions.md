# Stage 0 — engineering decisions made without asking

One line each: what was decided and why. Rules questions are not here; they go to
`docs/stage0_questions.md`.

- **Decision-coverage tool is `tools/decision_coverage.py`, not `tools/coverage.py`** — that
  name already means card-script test coverage (`data/COVERAGE.md`); renaming a shipped tool is
  churn for nothing.
- **Fuzz baseline re-taken on the committed tree** — the 046 ledger entry's random-agent digest
  (`a70eb43f…`, 33,954 actions) does not reproduce on `750c723` (`2e54e2c3…`, 33,880, stable
  across three runs); the Stage 0 entries use the reproducible figure and say so.
- **E1's four fixes share one commit and one regeneration** — three card scripts answered by name
  in the FAQ, each G0/G1 with disjoint golden keys; splitting them would cost three requalify
  cycles for no extra attribution (each key is localised to its own card in the entry).
- **Take Control's reduction is a helper (`ops.steal_reduction`) read by each effect steal** rather
  than a change to `push_steals` — `push_steals` is also called after the attack path has already
  subtracted it, and a second subtraction there would double-count.
- **Flathead's unblockability travels on `AttackContext`** (read once in `engine._attack`) — the
  FAQ fixes it at declaration; the field is in the attack key of `view.info_key`, so a search sees
  it as the public fact it is.
- **No editing of engine or script files while a verification job for the previous item is
  running** — E4's script edit landed while E3's fuzz was starting and could have contaminated
  E3's digest; the fuzz was re-run on the clean tree. Each item's golden cycle now completes
  before the next item's edit begins.
